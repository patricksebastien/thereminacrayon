# Theremin Ã  crayon

A theremin with a Surface Pro (custom instrument to draw and play music simultaneously.

## NOTES

- read serial in pd from uno theremin
- using rx-tx pin on arduino with open theremin (only pinb 0 is available)
- start pd with basic patch (sending osc xinput - serial comport etc)
- configure midi in with foot pedal
- communicating with gimp 2.10
- check if open theremin output serial the volume antenna too
- use tof - tats to send to pd (https://github.com/SofaPirate/AsciiMassage)
- check if pen is available with gesture recognition (easystroke) - YES need to choose button (2)
- is the pen eraser doing something?
- control gimp from pd using osc (hacking gimp) or use xdotool?
- pd sampler (mtl) doesnt work, try with pd048 or simply use .coll text file
